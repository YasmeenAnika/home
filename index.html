			<h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
			<p id="info">
				Hey, readers&#33;
				<br><br>My name is Anika Nawar Yasmeen, and I am attending Victoria Park Collegiate Institute for my first year of high school as a student in the ninth grade.
				<br><br>If this website has not yet informed you, I am extremely passionate about reading, books in particular. As the saying goes, <em>&#34;Books are a door to another world&#34;</em>&#33; And, believe me when I say that this is the truth&#33; If you have not yet gotten into the habit of reading every once in a while, be it a book, a magazine, or even a newspaper article, I strongly encourage you to start. After all, <em>&#34;The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn, the more places you&#39;ll go!&#34;</em> &#45;Dr. Seuss
