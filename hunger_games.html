			<br><br>Book 1 of The Hunger Games Trilogy.
			<br><br><em>The dictatorial nation of Panem, having risen from the remains of a post&#45;apocalyptic North America, is divided into 12 districts and the wealthy Capitol which governs them. As punishment for a past battle and for maintaining order throughout the country, the annual Hunger Games is practiced and forcefully celebrated to plant fear into the hearts of the citizens and prevent any future rebellion. Two representatives from each district, one male and one female, are selected at random during a lottery to compete in the yearly event. The competition takes place in an arena within the Capitol, where children between the ages of 12 and 18 are forced to participate in a brutal fight to the death until only a single survivor remains to be crowned the victor. It is televised and required that everyone watch the events unfold as a political strategy to demonstrate the government&#39;s oppresive influence and unstoppable, controlling power over the districts&#39; population...
			<br><br><br>When her younger sister, Prim, is picked to be the female representative of District 12, 16&#45;year&#45;old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to participate in her place. She and District 12 male representative, Peeta Mellark, must face the more powerful rival representatives, including those who been trained for this event their whole lives.</em>
