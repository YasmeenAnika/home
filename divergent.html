		<p>Tris Prior is the main protagonist and narrates all three books in the Divergent Trilogy. Strong&#45;willed, she hates showing weakness. Born in the faction Abnegation, she embraces her true self during the Choosing ceremony as she transfers to Dauntless and trains as an initiate, so it should not come as a surprise that she is brave. Tris is also selfless and intelligent, which explains her Divergence. Furthermore, she is willing to risk her life and make sacrifices for the people she cares about. As well, she has the two opposing characteristics of a temper and sensitivity. Tris is also known for her curiosity.</p>

		<p>Tobias Eaton is the deuteragonist of all three books in the Divergent Trilogy. He is the of the transfer initiates for Dauntless and was an initiate himself from former faction Abnegation. He is tough, intimidating and strong, and can be distant at times. However, he is also very protective of the people that matter to him. He changed his name to Four in acknowledgement of his four fears, the lowest number anyone has ever had.</p>
